This directory contains some earlier approaches to the project

1txtPhp: PHP approach. Contains an index.htm file, an associated eugenetech.php file, and jobs.csv. PHP code ingests jobs.csv, a coma-delimited text file with three columns: company names, links to jobs page, number of jobs. The PHP code generates HTML code that is inserted into index.htm. 

2ttGoogleDoc: JavaScript approach. Contains an index.htm file with embedded JavaScript. The javascript uses the TableTop framework to read data from a Google Docs table. 

3wpStyle: Modified to integrate with Eugene Tech's Wordpress site, using Scripts n Styles. JavaScript is moved to a separate file: myscript.js. CSS file mystyle.css is added. 

4multiCol: First attempt at multi column version, with links at top that let you choose the number of columns, causing javascript code to run that reformats the columns.
